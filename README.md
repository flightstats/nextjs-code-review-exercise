The proposed solution in the PR sets out to solve this story:

As a user, I'd need to calculate the flight time in hours and minutes given a departure airport, departure date/time,arrival airport, and arrival date/time given the following airport/time zone data:

```
[
  ["PDX", '-07:00'],
  ["FRA", '+02:00'],
  ["LGW", '+00:00'],
  ["BOS", '-04:00'],
  ["LAX", '-07:00'],
  ["SLC", '-06:00'],
  ["SEA", '-07:00'],
  ["SFO", '-07:00']
]
```
